# vnwork-2-dingtalk

Project aims to have an intuitive webservice to integrate with Search engine of [Vietnamworks](https://www.vietnamworks.com/)

Upon trigger, we expect to have relevant jobs to be sent as notification to Dingtalk.

Project was built based on https://github.com/sluongng/alicloud-fc-ts-template using TypeScript

## Why?

1. On VietnamWorks, often Salary, MinSalary, MaxSalary and other relevant information about a Job Listing are hidden on the UI.
    
    Here we aim to highlight these information.

2. Its convinience for me to receive notification via DingTalk.
