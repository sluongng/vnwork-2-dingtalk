# vnwork-2-dingtalk

Project aims to have an intuitive webservice to integrate with Search engine of [Vietnamworks](https://www.vietnamworks.com/)

Upon trigger, we expect to have relevant jobs to be sent as notification to Dingtalk.

Project was built based on https://github.com/sluongng/alicloud-fc-ts-template using TypeScript

## Why?

1. On VietnamWorks, often **Salary, MinSalary, MaxSalary** and other relevant information about a Job Listing are hidden on the UI.
    Here we aim to highlight these information.
    To find out more on what kind of information is available, read [This](https://github.com/sluongng/vnwork-2-dingtalk/blob/master/src/algolia/model.ts#L121)

2. Its convenience for me to receive notification via DingTalk.

## How?

VietnamWork(VNW) Search Engine is a 3rd party service called [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/)

But instead of having their GUI-ClientSide requesting ServerSide which aggergrate/filter information from Algolia Search Engine, VNW made it so that their Web-GUI client called Algolia directly.

As a result, information about their ApplicationID, ApiKey,... needed to be available from the client side so that the web browser could make a valid request to Algolia.

Moreover, this also lead to all the data, which VNW uploaded to Algolia to help with Search Indexing, became publicly available and is opened for datamining.

This is how the job listing will look like when posted into Dingtalk chat channel.
